I'm trying again to get a personal blog going. Hopefully this one lasts more than a few blog posts before I throw it out and start over, yet again.

I've always spent lots of effort setting up my past blogs. This time, I'm taking a completely different approach. Before, I've used [WordPress][], but I found it a hassle to keep it up to date. This time I'm using [Jekyll][] for my CMS. Jekyll is a small website framework written in [Ruby][] which generates static HTML files. It was created by one of [GitHub][]'s founders. Part of what makes it nice is that it's more intended to be a quick and elegant blogging engine, rather than just a static site generator. It lets me write my blog posts in [Markdown][], which is sweet.

I'm using [GitHub Pages][pages] to host my site, so I don't have to worry about another hosting service. I have a love/hate relationship with my [Slicehost][] instance. I love having full control over a server, but I hate having to manage that server. I also don't feel the need to pay $20 a month for a server that I barely use. Since I'm already paying for GitHub, it makes sense to consolidate my hosting there.

The other big advantage of GitHub Pages is that they have full Jekyll support. I do all my changes locally on my computer, commit the changes to the [git][] repo, push it to GitHub, and I'm done. No deploy scripts. Magic.

The source of my website is also [available][repo] in a public GitHub repo, so feel free to dig in and see what I've done.
