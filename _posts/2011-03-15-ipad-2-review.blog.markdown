title: My review of the iPad 2
---

The new [iPad 2][ipad] came out on Friday afternoon at 5:00 PM. I wasn't able to break away from work early enough to go and pick one up, and they were sold out (of course) by the time I was done with work. I heard that they were getting more on Saturday and Monday, so I decided to head over Saturday morning and try my luck. I got there at about 9:00, an hour before opening, and there were 10 people in line in front of me. About 15 minutes before the store opened, one of the Apple employees came out and told us that although they were expecting one, their shipment hadn't arrived yet, and they didn't know when it would. They also magically found 6 iPads overnight, so a few of the people in line ahead of me snatched them up. At around 10:30, their shipment arrived, with a grand total of 7 iPads. For the 80 or so people in line. Luckily, I was 6th in line, so I managed to get one, a 64GB Black Verizon model.

I'm a full-time iPhone/iPad app developer at [InspiringApps][inspiringapps], and I do some of my own stuff [on the side][strawmanstudios]. I have two of the original iPads, and use them every day. These are my opinionated feelings about the new model.

### Color

One of the guys sitting near me in line was returning an iPad he had picked up the night before. He got the white model, and was bringing it back to exchange it for a black one. Even after looking at it for 15 seconds, I knew that it wasn't the right choice for me. 

One of the most amazing things about the iPad (and iPhone) is that the device *becomes* the app. In other words, when you are playing a game on the iPad, you lose sight of the fact that you have a hunk of metal and glass, and the game is the only thing is important. With a white border around the screen, you lose that effect. It's the same reason that TVs have a black border and letterboxing is done with black bars.

I'm happy that I got the black model, and can't fathom any reason to have the white one, except to be different and cool.

### Smart Cover

I got the black leather [Smart Cover][smartcover]. I think it's really slick. It uses magnets to attach to the left side, and has another magnet that holds it closed. When you open the cover, it automatically turns on and unlocks the iPad. When you close the cover, it puts the iPad to sleep. It works as advertised.

However, Apple claims that the cover will clean the fingerprints off of the screen every time you open and close it. I haven't found this to be the case. Maybe if you were to slide the cover across the screen, instead of just slapping it closed, it might do something to help.

I do like how thin the cover is. I've never liked bulky cases on my iPhone or iPad, so I tend to keep them naked, but I worry about the screen getting scratched. The Smart Cover is a perfect compromise for me.

I am a bit concerned by a [tweet][dhh_tweet] I saw from [DHH]. Hopefully this is an isolated incident.

### Thinness

The new iPad 2 makes my "iPad classic" feel quite chubby. Apple was able to reduce the thickness of the iPad 2 by about 33% so that it's actually thinner than my iPhone 4, which is an amazing feat. The iPad 2 feels wonderful in the hand, and is much more comfortable to hold for long periods. And although the weight is approximately the same, the new shape makes the iPad 2 feel much lighter.

### Speed

Apple claims that the new A5 processor contained in the iPad 2 is twice as fast as the A4 processor in the original iPad, which makes sense since they went from a single core to a dual core processor. While I haven't run any CPU  benchmarks, it certainly does feel speedier. I did run a simple disk benchmark, and the "disk" in the iPad 2 is also about twice as fast as the disk in the original iPad, for both reads and writes. The iPad 2 has much faster graphics (up to 9 times faster, claims Apple). All of these things combined make the iPad 2 a pleasure in that department. Apps load much faster, scrolling is less jerky, everything just seems smoother. 

One of the apps I'm working on has some minor performance hiccups on the original iPad. On the iPad 2, I don't notice any issues at all.

### Cameras

Both the front and back cameras on the iPad 2 are pretty crappy. They serve their purpose, but don't count on them for anything more than Facetime/Photobooth or some grainy shots of kids playing at the park.

### Conclusion

The iPad 2 is a wonderful new piece of hardware. It runs all of the apps that are available in the App Store. It's thinner and faster than the original iPad. It's got cameras. So, is it worth upgrading if you've got the original iPad? Is it worth the $150 premium over the old iPad (which are available for $349 [refurbished])? I don't think so. While it's better in every regard, I feel like most of the changes are evolutionary, rather than revolutionary. The original iPad is good enough for the needs of just about everyone. My gut tells me that the iPad 3 will be a much bigger jump technologically, and I'd recommend waiting to upgrade.
